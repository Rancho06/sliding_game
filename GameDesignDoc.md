# Game Design
In this game, I have one player against five bad things. They are soldiers, rocks, tanks, planes, UFOs.

## How to play?
users use keyboard to control the player. UP is jump. LEFT and RIGHT is control left and right speed. Space is fire.

### Score
The score can't go down. Every time you kill a bad thing, you can add corresponding points of that thing. For example, 

A plane is difficult to be killed than a tank. so if you kill a plane, you get more points than killing a ank.
The final score is the score when you died.

#### Lives
The user should control the player to avoid the attack of bad Things. if the player is touched by a Bad Thing or
the bullets or something else from the Bad Thing, the player lost a life. Initially, every player has three lives.

We can keep track of lives using collision method. A player died after he lost all of his lives.

##### User Interface
Menu Bar: I will include an action called Exit

Tool Bar: Start Game, Pause Game, Quit game, Restart Game
